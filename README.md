# Christmas-Draw

If there are too many people to buy a Christmas gift for everyone, there is a solution.  Make a draw.  Each person is drawing another person and giving a present to him/her.  This software will perform the process.

Code was written in Intelji 2017. The executable file is in out/artifacts/ChristmasGifts_jar folder.


NOTE!
